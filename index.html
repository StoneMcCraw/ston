      <h2>Computer Shniz</h1>
        <li>Computers are one of the most important inventions ever. If computers had not been invented, technology would not be developed to its current state. Since the computers invention, society has changed drastically. Computer technology is so
          helpful that it is even used to create newer, better computer equipment. Almost everything today is linked in some way, to computers. Before computers were invented, very little was known about outer space. With the technology we have now,
          we
          are learning new things everyday. Computers are used to follow the paths of asteroids and predict their future movements.With this new found knowledge, we can watch anything from beyond the boundaries of earth. Like in 2029 we already know
          that an asteroid will come in 20,000 miles of the surface of earth. That's the circumference of the earth, and dangerous enough to destroy an entire city at a size of two football fields.</li>

          <h2>Car Shniz</h2>
          <li>If you look at a photo of New York City on New Year’s Eve in 1901, you see streets packed with horses and buggies. Fast forward to a photo taken from the same angle in 1914, and there is no trace of the buggies: They had been replaced
            by automobiles. After decades of auto technology that had evolved only marginally since the mid-20th century, experts say we’re now seeing a super-fast shift that's comparable to the industry's early days. From horse drawn carriages to
            “fast” moving automobiles that would usually take a man’s trip around the country serval days, to many months, and if they’re really unlucky, years. With the creation of the automobile, transportation has never been easier. Even though we
            came from riding on the leather of a horse to the leather of our car seats. Without the creation of the automobile we wouldn’t have advanced so quickly in such a short amount of time.</li>

            <h2>Camera Shniz</h2>
            <li>Since the dawn of man. We have always been invested in art and tried to portray any living or dead object. We started out using our creativity by using paintbrushes and paint. But seeing how lame painting is we invented time capture
              machines to be the same size of a as a baby’s hand. The creation of the camera made it so we could remember fond memories, remember dead presidents, capture the exact moment your enemies realize it’s you who betrayed the group. The
              creation of the camera has evolved social media around the teens of this generation but still be compatible with the generations of the past. I’m sure somebody like Van Gogh would have loved to have his own camera, more or less the
              telephone. But that’s not here nor there and for now we will need to rely on the inventor of tomorrow to further develop the new future. </li>

              <h2>Social Media Shniz</h2>
              <li>Today, everyone knows and uses social media. Even the most remote parts of the world have heard about Facebook and Twitter, and they probably use it every day too. However, it wasn't like this a decade ago. Not as many people had
                internet access at that time, and smartphones were not even introduced in the market. Today, most of us can't live without social media. In fact, we scroll through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Pinterest at least thrice every hour.
                As the millennium changed, almost 100 million people had access to the internet. At that time, however, social media was looked upon as an unusual hobby. Nevertheless, people all across the world began to use chat rooms to make new
                friends, to date, and to discuss topics with other like-minded people. However, the huge boom of social media was yet to come.</li>

              <h2>Phone Shniz</h2>
              <li>It's hard to believe that the initial concept for this form of communication technology began more than 400 years ago. And, just 150 years ago, in 1867, Alexander Graham Bell spoke the first official words into a telephone to Thomas
                A. Watson. This invention has since gone on to transform communications worldwide. Since the 1800s, the telephone has gone through hundreds of changes. Some are minute, others are complete upheavals. No matter what form the phone
                takes, however, it still completely revolutionized how society communicates and interacts with each other and continues to impact culture to this day. Due to the vast history of the phone, only a few major highlights will be covered
                here. For starters, the first phone with the ability to dial a number was invented in 1905. Almon B. Strowger is credited with creating the first rotary phone, eliminating the need for switchboards and operators. Despite this, they
                didn’t catch on until the 1920s. The Frankfurt “Bauhaus” is considered the first mainstream rotary phone.Jumping a few decades ahead, advancements like touchtone dialing and cordless phones are growing more commonplace in the 1970s.
                Around that time, AT&T began experimenting with a telephone that could transmit images during a call. It was deemed too bulky and expensive but laid the groundwork for what would eventually become video calls and text messages.</li>
